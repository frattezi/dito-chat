# Dito Chat App

## Brief explanation

I really like docker so i choose it thinking of some applications it provides.

So I created base dockerfiles containerizing the application and the backend, I'll explain both better in the next topics.

In the automation part I was lost as I only know gitlab-CI, with a little reasearch i choose Circleci for some reasons:
 - Proximity with gitlab-CI features
 - YAML files for configurations
 - Github integration
 - Heroku integration
